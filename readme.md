# Day 15 of My 3 Weeks Game Challenge

Classic snake game using P5.js

## User Stories

- [x] The snake never stops moving
- [x] I can control the snake with my arrow keys
- [x] I can see a randomly placed food
- [x] If the snake eats this food, it gets longer
- [x] If the snake hits the edge, it dies
- [x] If the snake bites itself, it dies
- [x] I can see the number of foods I collected

## Next Steps

I definitely need to add a splash screen on start and a game over screen with the final score and an option to restart the game.

It would be also great to make it mobile friendly and you could swipe to control the snake.
